## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

+ Creating S.M.A.R.T. goals is something I'm *very* familiar with, as I learned how to do so multiple times throughout middle and high school.
+ I'm also highly aware that mistakes are not only common, but often *necessary* in order to keep improving. As coding is work that tends to be mistake-heavy, recognizing that is incredibly important in order to continue improving and learning.

2. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

+ I approach a lot of the learning that I do open to mistakes, which is incredibly important for maintaining this growth mindset.
+ I also am more than willing to ask *tons* of questions, which is another key part of fostering a healthy growth mindset.
+ Lastly, with learning and building on knowledge, it's necessary to have something to work towards; I'm able to create S.M.A.R.T. goals to work towards for building that knowledge and continuously improving.
+ As such, I feel like there aren't many ways I don't demonstrate a Growth Mindset, if any. I feel *very* comfortable with this mindset and plan to continue to foster it.

3. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?

Hashes store individual *keys* that access *values* into a variable while arrays store multiple values without any keys attached. As such, hashes vary from arrays in that you can assign 'keys' to 'values' in hashes to better contextualize them, while you can't do that in arrays.

4. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
```rb
pet_store = {
  "dog_toys" => 78,
  "cat_toys" => 32,
  "dog_food" => 94,
  "cat_food" => 52
}
```

5. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?

```rb
puts "the value 'Iowa' is accessed like so: #{states["IA"]}"
```

6. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?

We can get all the keys and values with 'states.keys' and 'states.values', respectively.

7. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

Hashes could also be used for figuring out how many of each type of package are coming into a FedEx ground; boxes, tires, etc.

8. What questions do you still have about hashes?

I don't really have any more questions about hashes; I just need to get used to using them early and often!
