## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
The biggest things that resonated with me from this article was to take breaks - it's something I definitely don't do enough that I should start doing more!

1. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?
Through Ruby, I would type the following command:
  puts "Hello, World!"

1. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?
The pound sign.

1. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?
An integer is a numeric value without any decimals, while a float is a numeric value that contains decimals.
Integer example: 5 | Float example: 5.00

1. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string `"zebra"`
animal = "zebra"

1. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?
p "#{zebra}"

1. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.
Interpolation is placing a variable into another variable.
Example interpolation using the pervious variable:
favorite_animal = "The #{animal) is one of Alex's favorite animals in the zoo."

1. What method is used to get input from a user?
You can acquire user input using 'gets.chomp' which requires user input before further output can occur.

1. Name and describe two common string methods:

Loops - You can cause an output to occur multiple times by looping the output using x.times "string" where x is the number of times you want the string to loop and "string" contains whatever string you want to loop.
Booleans - A fairly simple way to create true/false statements. True/false statements either include equality or greater/less than symbols. Keep in mind that the contents of the true/false statement aren't printed, only the final result; as such, if you want the contents that cause the true/false statement to print, you need to express them in another way outside of the true/false statement itself.
