# In the below exercises, write code that achieves
# the desired result. To check your work, run this
# file by entering the following command in your terminal:
# `ruby section1/exercises/variables.rb`

# Example: Write code that saves your name to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
name = "Harry Potter"
p name

# Write code that saves the string 'Dobby' to a variable and
# prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
house_elf = "Dobby"
p house_elf

# Write code that saves the string 'Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!'
# and prints what that variable holds to the terminal:
no_return = "Harry Potter must not return to Hogwarts!"
p no_return

# Write code that adds 2 to the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
students = 22
p students
extra_students = 22 + 2
p extra_students

# Write code that subracts 2 from the `students` variable and
# prints the result:
# YOUR CODE HERE
p students
less_students = 22 - 2
p less_students

# YOU DO:
# Declare three variables, named `first_name`, `is_hungry` and `number_of_pets`.
# Store the appropriate data types in each.
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = 'Alex'
is_hungry = 'not currently'
number_of_pets = 5

puts "#{first_name} is #{is_hungry} hungry and has #{number_of_pets} pets."

# IN WORDS:
# How did you decide to use the data type you did for each of the three variables above?
## I opted to use the data types I did based off of both what types of information I was storing within the variables.


# Explain.

## In practice, I used a string to describe both my name and my state of hunger.
## I used a number for my five pets, as that was the most consise way to do so.


# YOU DO:
# Re-assign the values to the three variables from the previous challenge to different values (but same data type).
# print all three variables to the terminal.
first_name = 'Bob'
is_hungry = 'very'
number_of_pets = 'no'

puts "#{first_name} is #{is_hungry} hungry and has #{number_of_pets} pets."

# YOU DO:
# Using the variables below, print the total number of snacks to the terminal:
healthy_snacks = 6;
junk_food_snacks = 8;

puts "There are a total of #{healthy_snacks + junk_food_snacks} snacks in the house."

# FINAL CHECK
#-------------------

# Did you run this file in your terminal to make sure everything printed out to the terminal
  # as you would expect?
